Tumi's Java Examples

======================================

This repository is to store my java examples on learning Java, Jave EE and Spring. 

I'd been a Java developer in 2009, and then I became a .NET web developer and .NET Software Architect. When visited Java again in the end of 2013, I decide to spend my spare time for Java and will use it and PHPH for my open source or personal project.

All my examples will focus on:

- Java EE, Spring, Spring MVC
- JPA, NHibernate
- Gradle, Maven
- Groovy and Grails

I'm now just a new bie of Java, so please give me comments and advices. Feel free to contact me at tumivn [at] gmail [dot] com.
