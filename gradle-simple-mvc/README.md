Tumi's Java Examples

======================================

I've used MSBuild and Nuget for package management and automation build (with TeamCity / TFS). But I never use Ant for Java before. I've heard about Gradle, Maven and Jetty, and I want to get started with Java by learning a little bit of Gradle and Spring MVC first. 

This example is to use Gradle and a very simple web application using Spring MVC and Gradle. The full tutorial is available at [tumivn.com - my English blog](http://tumivn.com/2013/11/25/getting-started-with-spring-mvc-and-gradle/ "Tumivn.com").

I'm now just a new bie of Java, so please give me comments and advices. Feel free to contact me at tumivn [at] gmail [dot] com.
